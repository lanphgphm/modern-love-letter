# Modern Love Letter Generator 

This is a reimplementation of Christopher Strachey's Modern Love Letter algorithm with a more modern vocabulary set. When learning about Strachey's tool in a Literature class, I was not quite sure whether the letters read strangely because I know they are machine-generated, or because they use an older set of vocabulary with which I am unfamiliar. 

Made for LIT104 - Introduction to Literature: "What does it mean to be human?". Credit to Prof. Jasmine An for introducing me to Strachey's project, and for this phenomenal class.
